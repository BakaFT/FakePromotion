# IMPORTANT

This is a [Pengu Loader](https://github.com/PenguLoader/PenguLoader) Plugin

**This plugin on works on  Pengu Core 1.0.6-betaï¼ŒPlease get it on dev branch**

# Intro
This plugin allows it to show a fake Rank Level Promotion Animation after startup of game client.

Alternatively, a fake honor rewad animation is also supported.

You can try to edit the data in `/hooks/xhr_hooks.js` to  show what u want.

# Usage

Pengu Loader 1.0.6 only load a plugin when it have a `index.js`, so open commandline in this root folder and execute my pre-made scripts.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
After that, a `index.js` will be generated, and you are ready to go.

If u do not have npm installed. Try the pre-built version in this folder, it will show a promotion to Challenger animation seconds later after the LCU starts up.

# Tips on dev

Fake Arena mode ranking can be done by this way too :)
